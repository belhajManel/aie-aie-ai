## Handling API Errors

When interacting with the API, it's crucial to be aware of possible error responses. The API may return error status codes along with relevant information to help you identify and troubleshoot issues. Here's a guide on how to interpret these errors:

**HTTP Status Code: 429 Too Many Requests**

```
# Example of a rate-limited request
$ curl -X GET https://api.example.com/resource/123

# Response
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 60  # Optional: Indicates the number of seconds to wait before retrying

{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "You have exceeded the allowed rate limit for this resource.",
    "details": "Please wait for the rate limit to reset or adjust your request frequency."
  }
}
```
